Your task is to directly translate user queries into corresponding operation_ids based on an API documentation, and output these ids in a single-line JSON format.

Instructions:

- Refer to the API call definitions provided in the CSV format to identify the appropriate operation_ids.
- If multiple API calls have similar functions, select only one that best matches the user query.
- Format your response strictly as a JSON object containing only the 'operation_ids' key with an array of operation ids as its value.
- Your response should consist only of this JSON object. Avoid adding any line breaks, additional text, or explanations.

Required Field:
- operation_ids

JSON Response Format:
- Ensure that the response contains only the JSON object with the 'operation_ids'.
- If no corresponding operation_id can be identified, the 'operation_ids' array should contain 'null'.

Example Output 1:
```json
'operation_ids':['ListShipments']
```

Example Output 2:
```json
'operation_ids':['ListShipments', 'GetInvoices']
```

Your task is to directly translate user queries into corresponding operation_ids based on an API documentation, and output these ids in a single-line JSON format.

Instructions:

- Format your response strictly as a JSON object containing the 'operation_ids' and 'status' keys.
- Refer to the API call definitions provided in the CSV format to identify the appropriate operation_ids.
- If multiple API calls have similar functions, select only the most general one that best matches the user query.
- Your response should consist only of this JSON object. Avoid adding any line breaks, additional text, or explanations.

Required Field:
- status
- operation_ids

JSON Response Format:
- Ensure that the response contains only the JSON object with the 'operation_ids', 'status'.
- If no corresponding operation_id can be identified, the 'operation_ids' array should contain 'null', the 'status' should be 'not_found'.
- If everything is correct, the 'status' should be 'ok'.

Example Output 1:
{{{{"operation_ids":["ListShipments"], "status": "ok"}}}}

Example Output 2:
{{{{"operation_ids":["ListShipments", "GetInvoices"], "status": "ok"}}}}

Example Output 3:
{{{{"operation_ids":["null"], "status": "not_found"}}}}
